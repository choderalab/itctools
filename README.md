Tools for setting up ITC experiments in an automated fashion using the Tecan EVO and Auto-iTC 200.

New:
---
Run `bash install.sh` to set up a new python environment using miniconda at ${HOME}/miniconda. It should take care of all dependencies. 

To access the new python enviroment you can type 
```shell
source ${HOME}/miniconda/bin/activate 2.7
```
or extend your `${PATH}` variable with `${HOME}/miniconda/bin`:
```shell
export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/miniconda/bin
```
To use the scripts within an existing environment, please look at the dependencies and install them accordingly. You can use the requirements files from the installer.

You can then install the package using 
```shell
python setup.py install
```

Requires
--------
`anaconda` or `miniconda` with `python` 2.7 or 3.3  
`simtk` (which is part of `openmm`.)  
`numpy`  
`openpyxl`  
`pip` - to install:  
`behave`

Contains
--------
`itctools/`

A library for setting up experiments

  - `materials.py`
    - Contains the objects to define chemical compounds, solutions and mixtures
  - `procedures.py`
    - Contains classes that set up experimental procedures, like binding experiments or heat of mixing.
  - `labware.py`
    - Defines chemical containers and their locations on the EVO Deck.
  - `itctools.py`
    - Contains useful functions that don't fall into any other category. 

`scripts/`

Some example scripts that use the library.

  - `host_guest.py`
    - Prepares a worklist and xlsx file for titrating a host compound into several guests.
  - `mixture_heats.py`
    - Prepare a worklist and xlsx file for performing heat of mixing experiments.
    
`features/`

Test the integrity of the library. Run `behave` from top directory in order to make sure the scripts are functional.
