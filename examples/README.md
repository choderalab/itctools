# Example scripts

The `examples` directory contains a number of scripts that have been succesfully used to set up experiments. The examples produce Tecan EVO worklist files (`.gwl`) that can be used to set up a plate for experiments. They also produce a `.xlsx` spreadsheet that can be read by Microcal Auto-iTC200 software to perform experiments.

* `host_guest` - host:guest measurements from SAMPL4
* `mixture_heats` - heat of binary liquid mixing
* `human-serum-albumin` - drug binding to HSA
* `caii` - CAII:CBS standard reference measurements
