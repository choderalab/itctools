# Example scripts

The `examples` directory contains a number of scripts that have been succesfully used to set up experiments. The examples produce Tecan EVO worklist files (`.gwl`) that can be used to set up a plate for experiments. They also produce a `.xlsx` spreadsheet that can be read by Microcal Auto-iTC200 software to perform experiments.
